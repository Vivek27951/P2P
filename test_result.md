# P2P Marketplace Testing Results

## Original User Problem Statement
Develop a full-stack P2P marketplace application where users can list their personal items for rent, browse available items in their area, handle booking and payments securely, and rate each other after transactions. Include user authentication, geolocation-based search, item management, booking calendar, chat support, and a secure payment flow (e.g. Stripe).

## Development Progress

### Phase 1: Project Foundation & Authentication ✅
- [x] Set up FastAPI backend with MongoDB integration
- [x] Set up React frontend with Tailwind CSS  
- [x] Implement user authentication system (JWT)
- [x] Create user registration and login functionality
- [x] Set up protected routes and authentication middleware

### Features Implemented

   - User authentication (register, login, profile)
   - Item CRUD operations
   - Booking system
   - Review system
   - Real-time chat with WebSocket
   - MongoDB database with proper collections

2. **Frontend** (React + Tailwind)
   - Responsive layout with header and footer
   - Authentication pages (login, register)
   - Home page with hero section and features
   - Browse page with search and filters
   - Protected routes

### Services Status
- Backend: Running on port 8001 ✅
- Frontend: Running on port 3000 ✅
- MongoDB: Running ✅

### Next Phases
- **Phase 2**: Complete remaining pages (ItemDetail, AddItem, MyItems, Profile, Bookings, Messages)
- **Phase 3**: Implement Stripe payment integration
- **Phase 4**: Advanced features (geolocation, enhanced chat, notifications)
- **Phase 5**: Testing and refinement

## Testing Protocol
When testing this application:
1. Test backend APIs first using the testing agent
2. Ask user permission before testing frontend
3. Focus on core functionality first
4. Test authentication flow thoroughly
5. Verify real-time features like chat

## User Feedback Integration
- Take user feedback on UI/UX improvements
- Prioritize feature requests based on user needs
- Test thoroughly before implementing new features

## Recent Changes
- Fixed backend import issues for standalone module execution
- Created proper project structure with contexts and components
- Implemented comprehensive authentication system
- Set up responsive design with Tailwind CSS
